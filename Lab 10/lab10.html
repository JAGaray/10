    <h1 align="center">Lab 10 - Data<br>
    </h1>
    <h3>Due: end of class</h3>
    <h3>OVERVIEW<br>
    </h3>
    For this lab, you will do some basic manipulations of data. For
    this, you will need to do some File I/O and use structs (along with
    other data structures already covered in other labs). <br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>TASKS <br>
    </h3>
    The goal here is to keep track of population information about the
    countries of the world. <br>
    <br>
    <h5>Task 0:</h5>
    First, we need to decide the appropriate data structure for storing
    the data. Your instructor has supplied you with a file
    (populations.csv), which is a simplified version of data sourced
    from the <a
href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DVD/Files/1_Indicators%20%28Standard%29/EXCEL_FILES/1_Population/WPP2015_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.XLS">UN</a>
    (a few countries with non-ASCII characters in their name were left
    out just in case your program has problems with those). Save the
    file to $PWD. <br>
    <br>
    The format of the file is as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Columns 1-5: populations (in 1000s) of country in 1950, 1970,
        1990, 2010, 2015, respectively. Since the population is in
        1000s, the number is a real number. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Column 6: Name of country. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, a suitable data structure might be:<br>
      <tt>&nbsp; struct Country {</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string name;</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double pop1950;</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double pop1970;</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double pop1990;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double pop2010;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double pop2015<br>
        &nbsp; };</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp; struct World {</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numCountries;</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Country countries[MAXCOUNTRIES];</tt><br>
      <tt>&nbsp; } myWorld;</tt><br>
    </p>
    You will change this data structure later.<br>
    <h5>Task 0: </h5>
    Write a function to initialize myWorld to data read from the
    supplied data file. There are a few complications:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading the populations is straightforward, and can be done
        using the standard file IO functions we covered in class (i.e.,
        "&gt;&gt;" using an input stream). However, since the names of
        some countries contain spaces, we need to use getline instead of
        &gt;&gt; for the name field. Fortunately, the country is the
        final field so we can use "&gt;&gt;" to read the populations and
        then a getline to finish the line.<br>
      </li>
      <li>You will need to input data until the end of file is reached.
        Recall that getline's return value is false if at end of file,
        so its easy to check for this. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To check that you did this correctly, you may wish to use ddd to
      check the value of myWorld. <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Task 1:</h5>
    Write a program that prints the countries with the 3 largest growth
    rates between 1950 and 2015. Also modify the World data structure to
    store the indices of these 3 countries so that the searching can be
    avoided in the future. One algorithm to do this is a 3 pass
    algorithm; a better algorithm might be to keep track of the 'top 3'
    and adjust these as you iterate through the data structure. Print
    out the results in the following format:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>The fastest growing country is XXXXX, which grew by
        XXXXX% between 1950 and 2015.</tt><br>
      <tt>The 2nd fastest growing country is XXXXX, which grew by XXXXX%
        between 1950 and 2015.</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>The 3rd fastest growing country is XXXXX, which grew by
        XXXXX% between 1950 and 2015.</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    You may assume the precondition that there are at least 3 countries.
    <br>
    <h5>Task 2:</h5>
    Now we wish to find countries that had negative growth rates. Print
    the list of such countries in the following format:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>The following countries shrunk between 1950 and
        2015:<br>
        country 1<br>
        ...<br>
        country n<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    To do this efficiently, recall that you had computed the growth
    rates of all countries in the previous task. So, you should first
    modify the Country datatype to store the growth rate, and modify the
    previous code to save the computed growth rates of each country.
    Then, this task becomes simple (while staying efficient).<br>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>HAND IN</h3>
    <p>For full credit on this lab you should spread your program across
      multiple files, and also write a makefile. One suitable
      partitioning might be to put the structure definitions in a header
      file, the input routines in one file, and the task1 and task2 code
      in 2 files. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Your 136 instructor will tell you what to hand in and how.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>GENERAL COMMENTS FOR ALL PROGRAMS THIS SEMESTER </h3>
    <p>You should have the following header on all programs:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>/*<br>
          &nbsp; Author: &lt;name&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; Course: {135,136}<br>
          &nbsp; Instructor: &lt;name&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; Assignment: &lt;title, e.g., "Lab 1"&gt;<br>

        </tt></font></blockquote>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>GRADING</h3>
    <p>All 135 and 136 programs this semester will be graded on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Correctness: Does your program work? <br>
      </li>
      <li>Testing: Have you generated sufficient and good test data to
        give reasonable confidence that your program works?</li>
      <li>Structure: Have you structured your code to follow proper
        software engineering guidelines? This includes readability and
        maintainability.</li>
      <li>Documentation: How well documented is your code? Good
        documentation does not repeat the code in English, but explains
        the point of each code block, highlighting any design decisions
        and/or tricky implementation details. </li>
    </ul>
